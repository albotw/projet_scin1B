<p>This laboratory exercise asks
  students to design and code a series of recursive algorithms. Many, but not all,
  of these algorithms use the robot introduced in Chapter 2 of <cite>Algorithms
  and Data
  Structures: The Science of Computing</cite>.</p>
<h3>Robots</h3>
<p>The robot is available as a Java class named <code>Robot</code> (and a supporting
  class named <code>RobotRoom</code>). Programs that use these classes need to
  include two Java files: Robot.java and RobotRoom.java. The “<a href="#CourseInfo">Final
  Details</a>” section of this document explains how to find these files
and their documentation.</p>
<p class="local-item">Any Java source file that refers to the <code>Robot</code> or <code>RobotRoom</code> classes
  should “import” those classes, via the statement</p>
<pre><code>    import geneseo.cs.sc.*;</code></pre>
<p>at the beginning of the file.</p>
<p>Several of the methods students write in this exercise need to be tested in
  rooms other than the default one (specifically, in rooms that have colored
  tiles located in strategic places). There is 
  a <code>RobotRoom</code> constructor whose parameter is a string specification
  for the room. This constructor can create the rooms needed in this lab. See
  the documentation for <code>RobotRoom</code> for more information on 
  the constructor. Once an appropriate room exists, the four-parameter
  constructor for <code>Robot</code> can place a robot in that room.
  For example, the following statements first create a 3 tile wide by 10 tile
  high (including walls) room with a red tile 2 rows below
   the north wall in the center column, and then place
  a robot
  at the center of the south side of the room, facing the red tile:</p>
<pre><code>    RobotRoom room = new RobotRoom( "3 10 1 2 R" );
    Robot occupant = new Robot( 1, 8, Robot.NORTH, room );</code></pre>
<h3>Constructors in Subclasses</h3>
<p>A constructor is basically a method that initializes a new object (see Sections
  3.4.2 and A.4.4 of <cite>Algorithms and Data Structures: The Science of Computing</cite>).
  In Java, constructors have the same name as the class they initialize — for example, the constructors for <code>Robot</code> objects
  are named <code>Robot</code>, the constructors for instances of a hypothetical <code>ExtendedRobot</code> subclass
  of <code>Robot</code> would be named <code>ExtendedRobot</code>, and so forth.
  Note that subclasses don’t inherit constructors from their superclass
  the way they inherit other methods — for example, even if a constructor
  for <code>Robot</code> logically does everything necessary to initialize instances
  of an <code>ExtendedRobot</code> subclass, there is no way to automatically
  apply this constructor to <code>ExtendedRobot</code> objects.</p>
<p>Even though Java doesn’t do it automatically, one often wants to initialize
  instances of a subclass by just calling a superclass’s constructor. This
  will probably be the case for the subclass of <code>Robot</code> defined in
  this lab. To do this, define constructors for the subclass that do nothing
  but call the corresponding superclass constructor. Within a constructor, the
  word <code>super</code> can be used to call a superclass constructor. For example,
  to allow instances of an <code>ExtendedRobot</code> subclass of <code>Robot</code> to
  be initialized with their position, heading, and room (just like the four-parameter
  constructor for <code>Robot</code> does), include the following constructor
  in <code>ExtendedRobot</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    // Within the ExtendedRobot class...
    public ExtendedRobot( int column, int row, int heading, RobotRoom room ) {
        super( column, row, heading, room );
    }</code></pre>
<p>A statement such as the following implicitly uses this constructor to initialize
  an extended robot:</p>
<pre><code>    ExtendedRobot r = new ExtendedRobot( 1, 3, Robot.NORTH, myRoom );</code></pre>

<h2><a name="exercise" id="exercise"></a>Exercise</h2>
<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Exercise" -->
<p>Design and code recursive methods that solve each of the problems
  described below. The first five problems involve robots, and their solutions
  should be coded as methods of a subclass of <code>Robot</code>.
  The last problem can be coded as a static method in the main class.</p>
<h3>Find a Red Tile</h3>
<p>Design and code a recursive algorithm that causes a robot to move forward
  until it is standing on a red tile. If the robot is initially standing on a
  red tile, it should not move at all. Assume as a precondition that
  there is at least one red tile between the robot and whatever wall it is facing
  (although the red tile may be at the robot’s initial position).</p>
<h3>Red Line</h3>
<p>Design and code a recursive algorithm that makes a robot draw a straight red
  line <var>n</var> tiles long, where <var>n</var> is a parameter to the algorithm. Assume as preconditions
  that <var>n</var>&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0, the robot is initially standing on what will be the
  first tile of the line, facing in the direction the line should grow, and that
  there are no obstructions on the <var>n</var> tiles in front of the robot.</p>
<h3>Red Diagonal</h3>
<p>Design and code a recursive algorithm that makes a robot draw a diagonal red
  line <var>n</var> steps long, where <var>n</var> is a parameter to the algorithm.
  Assume as preconditions that <var>n</var>&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0, the robot is initially
  standing where the southwest tile of the line will be, facing north, and that
  there are no obstructions on the tiles that need to be colored for the line,
  or on any tile adjacent to those colored for the line.</p>
<p>As an example, here is a robot that has just drawn a 4-step diagonal. The
  robot started in the lower left corner of its room:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Elementary%20Recursion%20Lab_fichiers/lab-recursion1-1.gif" alt="[Diagonal Red Line to the North and East of SouthWest Corner]" height="343" width="343"></p>
<h3 align="left">Counting Red Tiles</h3>
<p align="left">Design and code a recursive algorithm that moves a robot forward
  until it comes to a wall, and returns the number of red tiles that the robot
  encounters on the way, including any red tile that the robot starts on, and
  any that is next to the wall.</p>
<h3 align="left">Spiral</h3>
<p align="left">Design and code an algorithm that makes a robot draw  draw a
  red, square-cornered, spiral,  in which the first side is <var>n</var> tiles
  long, and each subsequent side is 1 tile shorter than the previous side. In
  other words, the second side is <var>n</var>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 tiles long, the third <var>n</var>&nbsp;-&nbsp;2,
  etc. The
  length of the first side, <var>n</var>,
  is a parameter to the algorithm. Assume as preconditions that <var>n</var>&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0,
  and that there are no obstructions within the spiral’s bounding box (i.e.,
  within the smallest rectangular group of tiles that contains the spiral).</p>
<p align="left">For example, here is a robot that has just finished drawing a
  square spiral whose first side is 7 tiles long:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Elementary%20Recursion%20Lab_fichiers/lab-recursion1-2.gif" alt="[A Square Spiral]" height="343" width="343"></p>
<h3 align="left">Squaring</h3>
<p align="left">Design and code a recursive algorithm that computes <var>n</var><sup>2</sup>,
  where <var>n</var> is an integer parameter to the algorithm. The recursion
  should be based on the fact that, when <var>n</var>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0, <var>n</var><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<var>n</var>-1)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2<var>n</var>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1.
  When <var>n</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, <var>n</var><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 too.
  Assume as a precondition that <var>n</var>&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0.</p>
