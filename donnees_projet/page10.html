							<p>There is a wealth of information online about Penrose Tiling, which was 
								discovered by the British mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose, which I do 
								not propose to duplicate here.&nbsp; Briefly, <b>Bob</b> deals with the type of 
								Penrose tiling comprising two types of rhombus of equal side length.&nbsp; 
								Skinny Rhombi have interior angles of 36ยบ and 144ยบ; Fat Rhombi have interior 
								angles of 72ยบ and 108ยบ.&nbsp; These two types of rhombi can be fitted together 
								to form an infinite, aperiodic (i.e. non-repeating) tiling.&nbsp; All 
								references to Penrose Tiling within this Web site pertain to this type of 
								tiling.</p>
							<p>For more information, see Penrose's book <em>The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning 
									Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics </em>, Oxford University Press, 
								1989.</p>

							<p>Deflation is the process of producing planes of Penrose Tiling by splitting each 
								individual rhombi of an existing plane into adjacent clusters of smaller 
								rhombi.&nbsp; All these new clusters collectively make up the next "generation" 
								of the tiling.&nbsp; The ratio of the side length of new rhombi to that of 
								their "parent" rhombus is equal to the Golden Mean (1.618033...).</p>
							<p>The splitting up of individual rhombi is done according to strict geometrical 
								rules to ensure that the tiling increases indefinitely in size (as measured by 
								the number of rhombi contained) without aberrations occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
								particular, each rhombus has a specific orientation, which is of no subsequent 
								relevance to the discovery and investigation of the geodesic walks, and so is 
								not displayed by <b>Bob</b>.</p>
							<p><b>Bob</b> starts off with a single rhombus - fat or skinny - as the initial 
								seed for a tiling, and uses deflation to produce successive generations of 
								tiling.&nbsp; The number of rhombi in any given tiling is larger than its 
								predecessor by a factor converging on (approximately) 2.6 as the number of 
								deflations increases.</p>

							<p>Redundancy is inherent in the deflation process.&nbsp; When adjacent rhombi are 
								deflated, they will often produce a pair of child rhombi which are identical in 
								type, position and orientation, one exactly "covering" the other.&nbsp; These 
								redundant pairs are trapped during the deflation process by <b>Bob</b>, and one 
								rhombus of each redundant pair (chosen arbitrarily) is eliminated in order to 
								guarantee a correct deflation, and thus a tiling without aberrations.</p>
							<p>Another characteristic of deflation is that as the tiling grows, it often 
								surrounds "holes", typically near the perimeter of the tiling, which can then 
								persist from one deflation to the next.&nbsp; These holes do not signify an 
								error in the deflation process.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>Now comes the interesting bit.</p>
							<p>Dr. Collins discovered that, by following certain simple rules for traversing 
								rhombic Penrose Tiling, a variety of different patterns or "walks" becomes 
								apparent within the structure of the tiling.&nbsp; The first step in tracing 
								these walks is to mentally convert the rhombic tiling into a triangular 
								tessellation by inserting an extra edge across the shorter diagonal of each 
								rhombus.&nbsp; Then chose an arbitrary vertex within the tiling as a starting 
								point, and chose an arbitrary edge extending out from the vertex.&nbsp; Follow 
								this edge until you reach the next vertex, and then take the first edge on 
								your left (or right).&nbsp; Follow this edge until the next vertex and then 
								take the first edge on your right (or left).&nbsp; Carry on alternating between 
								left and right to trace out the walk thus:</p>
							<p><img src="Stephen%20Collins%20-%20Penrose%20Tiling%20Generator_fichiers/7.gif" height="337" border="0" width="341">&nbsp;</p>
							<p>"Spiky" walks such as the closed loop displayed here can be difficult to follow 
								visually, so for the sake of clarity, by default <b>Bob</b> displays walks by 
								joining the midpoints of adjacent steps of the walk, thus:</p>
							<p><img src="Stephen%20Collins%20-%20Penrose%20Tiling%20Generator_fichiers/8.gif" height="344" border="0" width="340"></p>

							<p>Above is an example of a walk (a <b>Small Circle</b>) whose path is roughly 
								circular, and comprised of 40 steps.&nbsp; A larger version (a <b>Large Circle</b>)

							<p>The walk displayed below may also seem to warrant classification as a circle for

							<br>Written by Gary Meisner: "PhiMatrix is a design and analysis 
application for Windows or Mac inspired by Phi, the Golden Ratio.  Use 
it to 
							unveil the beauty of nature's proportions or apply it to your own
 designs and artistic creations.  It overlays 
							a variety of tranparent grids over any other program to let you 
see and apply the golden ratio and other proportions 
							to any image, and is a great tool to achieve excellence in design
 and composition."
